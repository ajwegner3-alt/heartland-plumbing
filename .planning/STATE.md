## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Init]: Next.js App Router with SSG — every page pre-rendered; only contact form uses a Route Handler
- [Init]: next/font/google for Bitter + Nunito Sans — highest-impact LCP optimization; never use link tags
- [Init]: No component libraries (no shadcn/ui, no framer-motion) — client JS budget under 30KB
- [Init]: Resend for contact form email — Gmail SMTP blocked on Vercel serverless

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 2]: Resend API key must be added to Vercel dashboard before Phase 6 — test live form on first deploy, not locally
- [Phase 5]: Unique content briefs for all 8 area cities must be drafted before code is written — this is the work, not the pages
- [General]: Tailwind v4 + @tailwindcss/typography compatibility unconfirmed — run `npm show @tailwindcss/typography version` before install; fall back to Tailwind v3.4.x if needed
